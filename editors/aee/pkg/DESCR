aee (another easy editor) is intended to be a simple, easy to use
terminal-based screen oriented editor that requires no instruction to
use. The intended audience for aee ranges from people who are new to
computers to experienced software developers.

aee's simplified interface is highlighted by the use of pop-up menus
which make it possible for users to carry out tasks without the need to
remember commands. An information window at the top of the screen shows
the user the operations available with control-keys.

aee allows users to use full eight-bit characters.

aee comes with two editors:
* aee, a curses-based editor
* xae, an X11-based editor
